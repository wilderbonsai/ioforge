   Traditional developer bootcamps are extremely expensive (around 10,000 euro for 12 weeks), and teach you outdated skills technology. We focus on teaching how to build real world solutions, using the latest tooling. We enable students to learn in their own time, for a fraction of the price of traditional bootcamps.
