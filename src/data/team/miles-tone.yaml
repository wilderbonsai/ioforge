  Traditional developer bootcamps are extremely expensive and time intensive
  (around 10,000 euro for full time 12 weeks). They often have teachers that are
  still junior, and teach outdated skills and technology. For a big fraction of
  the price, we focus on guiding how to build real world, world class solutions,
  using the latest tools. We enable students to learn in their own time, and
  give them the confidence to embark on their digital journey.
