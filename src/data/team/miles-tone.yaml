  Traditional developer bootcamps are extremely expensive (around 10,000 euro
  for 12 weeks), and teach you outdated skills technology. For 50euro/month, we
  focus on guiding how to build real world solutions, using the latest tools. We
  enable students to learn in their own time, and have the confidence to embark
  on their digital journey.
